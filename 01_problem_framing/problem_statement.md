# Problem Statement & Scope

## Business Context

**ApexCare Medical Center** is a busy hospital where most patient visits are planned through appointments across departments like General Practice, Cardiology, Pediatrics, Orthopedics, Emergency Medicine, and Surgery. On a normal day, patients do not arrive evenly—some clinics are packed with long waiting lines, while others have empty time slots. During the busiest hours, when patients miss their appointments, it adds even more pressure, slowing care and wasting valuable clinic time. Over the past year, ApexCare observed increasing wait times and rising missed appointments, prompting the need for a structured operational analysis.

Doctors, nurses, and front-desk teams deal with these problems every day as they try to fit patients in, manage delays, and handle no-shows. But these challenges often feel like separate problems instead of one big story. Hospital leaders know that patient access, clinic flow, and appointment attendance are connected, but without seeing the full picture, they must rely on experience instead of clear information when making decisions.


## Why This Problem Matters to Leadership

Every day, hospital leaders try to make sure patients get care on time while managing a limited number of doctors and rooms. When waiting lines grow, it is hard to tell if the problem is too many patients, poor scheduling, or slow clinic flow.

Missed appointments quietly make things worse. Empty time slots waste valuable clinic time and cost the hospital money. Leaders want to improve service, but without seeing the full picture, they struggle to know where things are going wrong or what changes will help most.

Without a clear view of patient demand, clinic flow, and missed visits, leaders end up fixing small problems instead of solving the bigger issues behind access and capacity pressure.


## Executive Questions

### 1. Patient Demand & Bottlenecks  
**What is the overall patient demand pattern across time and departments, and where do operational bottlenecks emerge that may require capacity or staffing intervention?**

---

### 2. Clinical Throughput & Appointment Timeliness  
**How efficiently do patients move through the clinical visit, and where do delays and on-time performance gaps occur across departments and clinicians?**

---

### 3. No-Show Impact on Capacity  
**Which patient groups contribute most to missed appointments, and how can the hospital reduce no-shows?**


## Scope Definition

### In Scope

| Category | Focus Areas |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| **Patient Demand & Bottlenecks** | End-to-end appointment lifecycle from scheduling to visit outcome |
|  | Time-based demand patterns (Month, Day of week, Hour of day) |
|  | Department-level workload and congestion risk |
| **Clinical Throughput & Appointment Timeliness** | Patient flow efficiency (Waiting time, Consultation duration, Total visit time) |
|  | Appointment timeliness (On-time vs delayed starts) |
|  | Department- and clinician-level performance drivers |
| **No-Show Impact on Capacity** | No-show behavior and its impact on usable capacity |
|  | High-level patient segmentation (Age group, Gender, Nationality, Insurance provider) |
|  | Supports targeted interventions (Reminder strategies, Overbooking, Resource reallocation) |



## Success Criteria

This project will be considered successful if it enables leadership to make informed, operational decisions around patient demand, throughput, and appointment reliability. Key success criteria include:

- **Decision Clarity:** Enables leadership to quickly identify where demand pressure and bottlenecks exist.  
- **Operational Prioritization:** Supports prioritization of staffing, clinic scheduling, and intervention strategies.  
- **Capacity Recovery Potential:** Quantifies operational exposure due to missed appointments and inefficient workflows.  
- **Targeted Improvement Actions:** Guides actionable interventions to reduce delays and no-shows.  
- **Resource Optimization:** Supports efficient allocation of clinical capacity to maximize patient access.
