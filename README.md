# Healthcare Operations Intelligence — ApexCare Medical Center

## Overview

This project studies hospital data from **ApexCare Medical Center** to understand what patients experience during a typical visit.

Every day, patients arrive expecting timely care, but some departments get crowded, some hours feel rushed, and many patients wait longer than they should. This project tells the story behind that experience by following how patients move through the hospital—from booking an appointment to seeing a doctor—and showing where things slow down.

It answers three simple but important questions:
- **Where and when patient demand is highest**
- **Why patients spend so much time waiting before care begins**
- **How missed appointments quietly waste hospital capacity**

By turning daily hospital activity into clear patterns across departments, time, and patient groups, this project helps hospital leaders see what is really happening on the ground and make smarter decisions to improve flow, reduce delays, and use existing resources more effectively.

## What This Project Makes Possible

This project turns everyday hospital activity in ApexCare Medical Center into **clear, actionable insight**. It shows exactly **where demand concentrates, where time is lost, and where capacity is wasted**, replacing guesswork with evidence.

### What Leaders Gain
- **Clear demand visibility:** which departments are busiest, and when peaks occur by day, hour, and season.
- **Understanding of delays:** where waiting builds up in the patient journey, especially before care begins.
- **Fair performance measurement:** separating system delays from clinician performance using contextual SLA views.
- **Recovered capacity:** identifying high-impact no-show segments where small improvements unlock many appointments.
- **Smarter use of existing resources:** shifting staff, time, and slots to the right places without adding headcount or space.

In short, the project helps leaders **see the whole system clearly and act precisely** to improve flow, reduce delays, and use current resources more effectively.

## Project Architecture (High Level)
**Problem Framing** → **Data Foundation** → **Analytical Engineering** → **Executive Outputs**

- **Problem Framing:** Sets the business context, defines why the problem matters to leadership, and clearly states the three executive questions around demand, delays, and no-shows.

- **Data Foundation:** Brings together data sources, profiling, cleaning, and modeling to create accurate, reliable hospital data ready for analysis.

- **Analytical Engineering:** Builds a business-ready semantic model that converts raw events into consistent metrics that can be fairly compared across departments, clinicians, and time.

- **Executive Outputs:** Translates analysis into clear insights, recommendations, and dashboards that show where problems exist and what actions leaders can take.
