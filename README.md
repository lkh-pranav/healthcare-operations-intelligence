# Healthcare Operations Intelligence — ApexCare Medical Center

## Executive Summary
This project studies hospital data from ApexCare Medical Center to understand **where most patients come from, why patients experience delays, and how hospital processes affect care delivery**. Using SQL, Python, and Power BI, raw appointment and visit data is turned into **clear, easy-to-read insights** that help hospital leaders plan capacity, improve workflows, and review performance using data instead of opinions.

---

## Executive Questions Addressed

### 1. Patient Demand & Bottlenecks
Which departments are the busiest, **when patients come in (day, hour, month)**, and **where crowding or slowdowns happen** that may need more staff or better planning?

### 2. Clinical Throughput & Appointment Timeliness
How smoothly patients move through a hospital visit, **where waiting time builds up**, and which departments or schedules struggle to start appointments on time?

### 3. No-Show Impact
Which patient groups miss appointments the most, and **how missed visits reduce hospital capacity** that could have been used for other patients?

---

## Decisions This Enables
- Where to **add or shift capacity** (by department, day, hour, or season)
- How to **improve front-end workflows** like check-in and triage to reduce waiting
- How to **measure clinician performance fairly** using SLA benchmarks
- How to **reduce the impact of no-shows** using smarter scheduling instead of blind overbooking

---

## Tools Used
**SQL** | **Python** | **Power BI**

---

## Project Architecture (High Level)
**Business Framing** → **Data Foundation** → **Analytical Engineering** → **Executive Outputs**

- **Business Framing:** Start with clear executive questions about demand, delays, and missed appointments  
- **Data Foundation:** Clean, structured hospital data built into reliable tables for analysis  
- **Analytical Engineering:** Metrics designed so departments and time periods can be compared fairly  
- **Executive Outputs:** Power BI dashboards that turn numbers into decisions, insights, and recommendations
